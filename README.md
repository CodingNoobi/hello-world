# hello-world

first time doing this hehe

I'm CodingNoobi, and I'm 15 years old. I've been taking a computer science course that teaches python basics, but
I want to move beyond turtle. I'm still quite new to programming, I mean I did play around a bit on codeacademy a couple years ago, but There's a lot of terminology I'm unfamiliar with and a lot I have to learn. I want to get better and be able to program video games someday, but to do that I need to learn more. I hope you guys are okay with helping me get more deep into coding. I've enjoyed it a lot so far, but I guess I'm just nervous about people shouting in my face about how little I know. But, Everyone starts somewhere right? I want to do this in the future, as a job possibility, so I want to do what I can to expand my horizons. I hope your community welcomes me and is alright with helping a beginner like me grow more :)
